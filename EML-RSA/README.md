# EML-RSA
This is a project of the Security Enginnering subject from University of SÃ£o Paulo. 
In this project, we developed a study about criptography algorithms analyzing 4 specific points:
- Algorithm type
- Key strength
- Key sharing mode
- Operating characteristics

In order to do this, we used 4 algorithms:
- DES
- AES
- RC4
- RSA

Lastly, we implemented our version of RSA called EML-RSA (initial letters from authors names) using C++11.

# Used Libraries
To handle with large key numbers we used the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP), available at the link below:
https://gmplib.org/
